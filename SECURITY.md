# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the **n.Tec-5---BACK-END** repository. We take security seriously and are committed to promptly addressing any vulnerabilities. This policy is intended for security researchers, contributors, and users who wish to report potential security issues.

## Supported Versions

We strive to maintain and secure the most recent version of our software. At any given time, only the latest release (or active development branch) is officially supported with security updates. Users running older versions are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release to benefit from security fixes and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability within this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose:**  
   Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it. Public disclosure before remediation can put users at risk.

2. **Report Privately:**  
   Send an email with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, the affected components, and any suggested fixes, to our security team at:  
   **[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)**  
   *(Replace with your actual security contact email.)*

3. **Include Contact Information:**  
   Provide your contact details so that we can reach you if additional information is required.

4. **Use Clear and Concise Language:**  
   Ensure your report is clear and provides enough detail for us to reproduce and understand the issue.

## Response Process

Upon receiving your report, we will:
  
- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 72 hours.
- Investigate the reported issue and work on a resolution.
- Provide you with updates on the progress of the remediation.
- Coordinate with you for any further information if necessary.
- Publicly disclose the vulnerability once a fix has been implemented, following responsible disclosure practices.

## Remediation and Disclosure

Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will release a security advisory that outlines:
  
- The nature of the vulnerability.
- The impact of the vulnerability.
- The steps taken to remediate the issue.
- The updated versions that include the fix.

## Security Best Practices

We recommend that users and contributors follow these best practices:

- Regularly update to the latest version of the repository.
- Review and follow our coding guidelines to prevent introducing vulnerabilities.
- Use secure coding practices and libraries.
- Report any suspicious behavior or potential security issues immediately.

## Legal

By submitting a vulnerability report, you agree that you are acting in good faith and that you have not exploited or otherwise misused any vulnerabilities for unauthorized purposes. We appreciate your help in maintaining the security and integrity of this project.
