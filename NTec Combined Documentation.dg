##NTec Combined Documentation

NTec is a modular, AI-driven auto-tuning system designed for advanced engine calibration and dynamic automotive performance management. This document provides a technical overview of both the back-end and front-end components.

Section 1: NTec Back-End

Overview:NTec Back-End is a modular, AI-driven auto-tuning system that integrates advanced calibration techniques with real-time sensor feedback. It manages engine calibration maps and applies dynamic tuning adjustments based on sensor inputs and AI-based gradient optimization.

Key Functionalities:

1. Base Map Loading:

• Manages engine calibration maps by parsing and loading predefined engine data into memory.

• Serves as the baseline configuration for further tuning operations.

2. Gradient Tuning:

• Uses AI recommendations (likely employing gradient descent or similar optimization algorithms) to adjust calibration parameters.

• Adapts performance parameters based on real-time sensor feedback.

3. Detuning on Part Degradation:

• Implements safety protocols by reducing tuning parameters when sensor data indicates mechanical degradation.

• Prevents damage under degraded conditions.

4. Active Aerodynamic Control:

• Manages aerodynamic components using live sensor data to optimize performance during dynamic maneuvers.

5. Active Lambda Control:

• Continuously adjusts the lambda target to maintain an optimal air–fuel ratio for performance and emissions control.

System Architecture:

• Modular Design (configurable via YAML files).

• Real-Time Sensor Feedback.

• AI Integration for predictive tuning.

• Safety and Reliability mechanisms.

Setup and Deployment:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.

3. Configure the system via YAML files.

4. Launch the system: python -m src.main.


Section 2: NTec Web (Front-End)

Overview:NTec Web is the interactive front-end interface for the NTec auto-tuning system. It integrates live sensor data, AI decision-making, and real-time controls, enabling both automated and manual tuning adjustments.

Key Features:

1. Real Sensor Integration:

• Retrieves live sensor data from a CAN bus or simulates data when unavailable.

2. Advanced AI Decision-Making:

• Employs a TensorFlow model to predict optimal tuning adjustments based on sensor inputs.

3. Interactive Front-End Controls:

• Dynamic dashboards, charts, and control panels built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. Calibration Map Persistence:

• YAML files for storing and retrieving calibration maps, enabling iterative testing.

5. Deployment and Quick Start:

• Automation script (quick_start.sh) to streamline setup and application launch.

System Architecture:

• Modular and Extendable.

• Real-Time Data Pipeline integrated with AI models.

• User-Centric Design for flexibility and oversight.

• Technology Stack: Python for back-end processing, HTML/CSS/JS for front-end.

Quick Start Instructions:

1. Run the quick start script: ./quick_start.sh.

2. Launch the interface to control the tuning process.
